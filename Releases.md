## Release Notes

**2.1.0**
1. *PlantNet*: the convolutional neural network for this release was developed using transfer learning. The full implementation is available [in this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/UPstartDeveloper/DS-2.4-Advanced-Topics/blob/main/Notebooks/Computer_Vision/Plant_Vision.ipynb).
2. If you wish to access the weights and biases of the CNN used in production, you can download them [here](https://github.com/UPstartDeveloper/DS-2.4-Advanced-Topics/tree/main/Notebooks/Computer_Vision/checkpoint) (same repo as above). Look for the files that start with `inception`.
