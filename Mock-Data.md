# Mock Data for Models

Use the screenshots below to guide you as you make the dummy instances of the Question and Mission models on your local environment.

You will need to create a super user account on your local version of the project, and then you can create the models just from the Admin Dashboard.

## Mission Model

Sorry I changed the model in the middle of making these screenshots - you should have no problem though, since the new fields I added are nullable. Please go ahead and enter the data that's applicable in each shot, and please ping @UPstartDeveloper in a GitHub issue if any problems arise!
