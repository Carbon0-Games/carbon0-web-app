*About Me*: I am an 19 year-old student at Make School, and software engineer who loves to build, design, and ship software products that can change the world. I was born in Pakistan, and grew up in the Northeastern United States. 

*Feature*: I helped set up a lot of the view controllers, URL patterns, and several HTML templates in the `carbon_quiz`, `api`, and `accounts` apps.

*Technologies*: Django, PostgreSQL and Bootstrap 4

*Fun Fact*: When I'm not coding, I love interviewing devs and startup founders about personal development - you can follow my podcast [In the Making](https://anchor.fm/maker-nation) to hear some of my conversations!
